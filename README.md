# Deep Learning Lab Projects
Hosting the notebooks for code submitted as part of the Deep Learning Lab, part of BTech Data Science, Manipal Institute of Technology.<br>

[Week1- NeuralNetworks-MNIST](/Week01-MNIST-NeuralNetworks.ipynb):<br>
The trasitional introduction to Deep Learning by training a Neural Network on the MNIST dataset.

[Week2-Hyperparameter Tuning](/Week02-Hyperparameter-Tuning.ipynb): <br>
Trained Artificial Neural Network to perform Prediction of Body Fat with the objective of learning about Hyperparameter Tuning.  The hyperparameters of the network were tuned and the corresponding accuracy and loss for each combination was plottted and analyzed.

[Week3-CNN-LeNet CIFAR10](/Week03-CNN-LeNet-CIFAR10.ipynb): <br>
Implemeted CNNs and LeNet architecture, trained and tested on the CIFAR10 dataset.

[Week4-Transfer Learning on CNN architectures](/Week04-AlexNet-VGG16-GoogleNet-ResNet50-EfficientNet-MobileNet.ipynb): <br>
Learnt Trasnfer Learning and compared all popular CNN architectures like AlexNet, VGG16, GoogleNet, ResNet50, EfficientNet and MobileNet on the Horse2Zebra dataset.

[Week5-Tensorflow Functional API](/Week05-Tensorflow-Functional-API.ipynb): <br>
Learnt to use the Tensorflow Functional API to train a branched Neural Network and compared performance with that of the Sequential API.

[Week6-Wide&Deep and Deep&Cross Networks](/Week06-Deep&Wide-Deep&Cross-Networks.ipynb): <br>
Excercising the functional API to create architectures where the wide part is a linear model using sparse representation, the deep part is a feed-forward network using dense representation, and the cross part applies explicit feature crossing.

[Week7-RNNs & LSTMs for Time Series Modelling](/Week07-RNNs-LSTMs.ipynb): <br>
Used RNNs & LSTMs to predict stock price movement.

[Week8-LSTM & Bidirectional RNN](/Week08-NLP-BidirectionalRNN.ipynb): <br> 
Introduction to NLP, where I trained a Long-Short-Term-Memory Network and a Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network on the IMDB Reviews Dataset for Sentiment Analysis.

[Week9-MockExam](/Week09-MockExam.ipynb): <br>
Mock Exam: using RNNs to predict crime occurence.

[Week10-FinalExam](/Week10-FinalExam.ipynb): <br>
Final Exam: comparing performance of pretrained VGG16 vs custom CNN architecture for Image Classification.
